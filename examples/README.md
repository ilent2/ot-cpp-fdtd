Examples
========

This directory contains examples of how to use the ot-cpp-fdtd package.
To compile the examples you will need to add the package to the
include path and call your favourite C++14 compiler.
If you have GNU Make, you should be able to simply call

```
make all
```

or for a specific example

```
make <exampleName>
```

in this directory or use the Makefile in the corresponding sub-directory.
