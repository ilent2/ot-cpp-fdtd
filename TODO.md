TODO list for potential goals to be able to publish a toolbox paper:

* Profile the implementation:
  - Work out when different memory structures are preferable
  - Show clear justification for the use of templates

* Simplify user interface
  - This is particularly important for file opening
  - Static variables are a bit clunky sometimes
  - For simple tasks, there is a lot of redundant setup required

* Library interface
  - How could we incorporate this into a easy-to-use library?
    Whould we need to allow dynamic allocation of memory?

* Other features
  - Look at other features from honours repository
  - Explore different coordinate systems
  - Torque calculation methods
  - Near-to-farfield transformation
